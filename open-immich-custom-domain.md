# Access Your Local Immich Installation Over the Internet Using Your Own Domain

In this guide, you will learn how to open your local installation of Immich to the internet using your own domain, even if you're behind Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT), which means your Internet Service Provider (ISP) assigns you a shared public IP address. To work around this issue, we will use Cloudflare (the free plan is sufficient) to create a tunnel from the internet to your machine, enabling you to use `subdomain.yourdomain.tld` to access Immich.

> :warning: *Cloudflare's free plan has a payload size [limit of 100MB](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/). Uploading files larger than this limit **will not work** over the internet. You can still do it on your local network.*

> :pray: *If you notice mistakes or have suggestions to improve this tutorial, feel free to open an issue or a PR.*

## Prerequisites

1. A working installation of Immich on your local machine.
2. A registered domain name.

## Step-by-Step Guide

## 1. Add your website to cloudflare

### 1. Sign Up for Cloudflare and Add Your Domain

1. Go to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) and sign up for an account.
2. Once signed in, add your domain to Cloudflare. Follow the on-screen instructions to change your domain's nameservers to Cloudflare's nameservers.

![Step 2: enter your existing domain in cloudflare](./img/sc01.png)

3. Assuming you already own a domain that was purchased elsewhere, you'll need to configure its nameservers to Cloudflare. This means Cloudflare DNS will be responsible for translating your domain name into an IP address. Cloudflare provides a great on-screen tutorial explaining this process. Essentially, you copy Cloudflare's nameservers and paste them into your domain's nameserver configuration at your registrar (e.g., GoDaddy).

![Step 3: transfer your domain nameserver to cloudflare](./img/sc02.png)

4. Click on `Continue` and wait for the changes to take effect. This can take up to 24 hours.

### 2. Install Cloudflare Tunnel on Your Local Machine

Now that Cloudflare DNS is managing your domain, you can easily set the IP address it should translate to. If you have a static IP address for your Immich server, simply set it in Cloudflare, and you're done. If you have a dynamic IP address that rotates but is dedicated to you, it's a bit more complicated but still relatively straightforward. You need to set the IP address initially and keep it updated whenever it changes (there are scripts available online and some routers that can automate this).

The problem many of us with a regular home internet contract face is that our ISP assigns us a shared IP address. This means that the IP address seen by the internet is shared among multiple households, making it impossible to set an IP address at the DNS level that uniquely identifies our home server running Immich.

Enter Cloudflare Tunnels! By installing a piece of software from Cloudflare on your server, a connection to Cloudflare is established. This allows Cloudflare to route all requests to your domain directly to your home server and provides free HTTPS encryption.

1. From your cloudflare dashboard, go to `Zero Trust` on the left-side menu.
2. In the Zero Trust section, select `Networks` -> `Tunnels`.

![Step 5: find cloudflared tunnels in Zero Trust](./img/sc04.png)

3. Click on `Create tunnel` and select `Cloudflared` as your connector

![Step 6: create cloudflared tunnel](./img/sc05.png)

3. Follow the instructions to name your tunnel, download, and install the connector on your server. Once the connection is established, it should appear immediately on Cloudflare.

4. Create a route for your tunnel. This is where you point your domain (e.g., `photos.yourdomain.com`) to your Immich installation on your local server (`http://localhost:2283`)

![Step 6: create route](./img/sc06.png)

And voilÃ ! You should now be able to access your local Immich installation from outside your home network at `https://photos.yourdomain.com`.

## 2. Set up Cloudflare Access

[Cloudflare Access/Zero Trust](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/zero-trust/products/access/) provides security which will block any requests without authentication.

The benefit of using Cloudflare (and Cloudflare Access) is that you can securely expose your Immich server on the internet and have Cloudflare act as a gatekeeper. If your Immich app was targeted in an attack, the attacker would have to go around Cloudflare first.

### Security

To prevent an attacker bypassing Cloudflare, you should not accept http/https traffic from IP addresses that aren't Cloudflare. You should also validate the connection coming from Cloudflare.

### 2.1. Limit incoming IP traffic

Using Ubuntu's UFW (uncomplicated firewall), set it up to deny all traffic by default, except for added rules.

You might want to follow this guide to [setup UFW](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-firewall-with-ufw-on-ubuntu).

Create a script:

```bash
$ sudo nano /usr/bin/cloudflare_ip_update
#/bin/sh

for cfip in `curl -sw '\n' https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v{4,6}`; do ufw allow proto tcp from $cfip to any port 443 comment 'Cloudflare IP'; done
ufw reload > /dev/null

# (press) ctrl-x and save (y key)
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/cloudflare_ip_update
# run your script to add UFW rules
$ /usr/bin/cloudflare_ip_update
```

The script will download Cloudflare's IP ranges and allow HTTPs traffic from those ip addresses.

Check UFW status to see IP address ranges added

```bash
$ sudo ufw status verbose
Status: active
Logging: on (low)
Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), deny (routed)
New profiles: skip

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
443/tcp                    ALLOW IN    173.245.48.0/20            # Cloudflare IP
...
```

Add your the script to crontab:

```bash
$ sudo crontab -e

0 0 * * 1 /usr/bin/cloudflare_ip_update > /dev/null 2>&1
```

That will make the script run daily.

### 2.2. Cloudflare Origin Server

This section will create an SSL certificate for your server. This removes the need for you to generate a publicly-trusted SSL certificate, or using a self-signed certificate that can be exploited by MITM attacks. We will use nginx here for the example config.

[Cloudflare documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/origin-ca/)

Navigate to Cloudflare Origin Server page:

![cloudflare ssl overview](./img/cloudflare_origin_server.png)

Next, create an origin certificate and copy the contents into:

- `/etc/ssl/private/cf-cert.pem` - contains the certificate
- `/etc/ssl/private/cf-cert.key` - contains the key

Snippet with SSL parameters in your nginx file (in `/etc/nginx/...`):

```bash
# default server SSL configuration
server {
  listen 443 ssl http2 default_server;
  listen [::]:443 ssl http2 default_server;
  server_name _;

  ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/private/cf-cert.pem; # <- add this
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/cf-cert.key; # <- add this too
  # ssl_client_certificate /etc/ssl/cf.crt;
  # ssl_verify_client on;
```

Next, reload/restart nginx (f.e. `systemctl reload nginx`), go to the Overview page (in Cloudflare) and enable Full (strict) SSL/TLS encryption mode.

### 2.3. Cloudflare Authenticated Origin

This section installs Cloudflare's certificate authority certificate which Nginx will use to validate the request is really coming from cloudflare.

[Cloudflare documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/authenticated-origin-pull/set-up).

Navigate to Cloudflare Origin Server page:

![cloudflare ssl overview](./img/cloudflare_origin_server.png)

Turn on Authenticated Origin Pulls:

![cloudflare authenticated origin](./img/cloudflare_authenticated_origin.png)

Add cloudflare's client certificate to `/etc/ssl/cf.crt`

You can also get this from [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/origin-ca/#cloudflare-origin-ca-root-certificate)

Snippet with SSL parameters in your nginx file (in `/etc/nginx/...`):

```bash
# default server SSL configuration
server {
  listen 443 ssl http2 default_server;
  listen [::]:443 ssl http2 default_server;
  server_name _;
  ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/private/cf-cert.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/cf-cert.key;

  ssl_client_certificate /etc/ssl/cf.crt; # <- add this
  ssl_verify_client on;                   # <- add this
```

Finally, reload nginx and test it working. You can also try to connect to your server directly (bypassing cloudflare). Nginx should reject your request as you aren't presenting a client certificate.

### 2.4 Cloudflare Zero Trust

Once all the security is in place and no-one except cloudflare can talk to your nginx, it's time to set up Cloudflare Access, which will set up a login page in front of your Nginx and won't allow traffic through unless you are authenticated.

Navigate to Zero Trust:

![zero trust nav](./img/cloudflare_zero_trust.png)

Navigate to Access -> Applications:

![applications](./img/cloudflare_zero_trust_applications.png)

1. Click `Add an application`
1. Select `Self-hosted`
1. Configure a name, domain name and click Next
1. Add a policy name, in the Rules section add Include Email like this: ![rules](./img/cloudflare_zero_trust_rules_email.png)
1. Click `Next` and then `Add application`

Navigate to your Immich server, you should now be presented with a Cloudflare page requiring you to login. It will send an email to you with a Pin, which you will need to type in. Once authenticated, you will be able to access Immich.

### 2.5 App access with Cloudflare Zero Trust

Add a service token, select a long expiry (or not expiring).

![service token](./img/cloudflare_zero_trust_service_token.png)

Save the Client ID and Secret values. It will appear as something like this:

```
CF-Access-Client-Id: 12345.access
CF-Access-Client-Secret: super-secret-secret
```

In Cloudflare:

1. Go back to Applications (in zero access)
1. click Edit on your Application
1. in the `Policies` tab, click `Add Policy`
1. name the policy `service` and in `Action` choose `Service Auth`
1. under Rules, choose `Include` and `Any Access Service Token` in the dropdown
1. Save

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> It's important to set the `Action` to `Service Auth` and not `Allow` for the service token policy

In the Immich app:

1. open settings
1. open Advanced Settings
1. open Proxy Headers
1. Add `Cf-Access-Client-Id` as the header name and paste the value of the header (the value after the colon character). For example: for `Cf-Access-Client-Id: 12345.access`, `12345.access` is the value to paste into the header value field.
1. Add another header
1. Add `Cf-Access-Client-Secret` as the header name and paste the value of the secret
1. Navigate back to the login page, and login with your server URL.

You can reuse the same client id and secret credentials for all users of the app, they will then login individually to Immich. The client ID and secret are to authenticate cloudflare.

#### Troubleshooting

- Logging into Immich says "Unknown app/server version". - it's likely that some part of the authentication didn't work, check it working in the browser, or use `curl` to test the connection

```bash
curl -v -H "CF-Access-Client-Id: 12345.access" -H "CF-Access-Client-Secret: super-secret-secret" https://immich.my-immich-domain.com
```

If in the output you are seeing Cloudflare and not Immich responses, then the authentication isn't working. Refer to the guide higher up to verify all the steps have been done.
